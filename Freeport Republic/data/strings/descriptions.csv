fpr_microphasecloak,SHIP_SYSTEM,"This device was reverse engineered from a similar piece of tech found on a drifting derelict out in deep spa, believed to have belonged to a Domain-era Explorarium Vessel. It allows the unmanned drone to temporarily dive into an alternate dimension known as p-space. The ship can still be detected by its phase coil emissions, but can not be hit by any weapons. Flux can not be dissipated in p-space, resulting in a constant buildup that forces the ship to come back to normal space eventually. Subjective time passes more quickly for the drone while in p-space.

The phase cloak generator is large and has significant power requirements, and so generally replaces shields as a ship's primary means of defense.",Special,Moves the ship into an alternate dimension where time passes more quickly. Ship can not be hit by any weapons; builds up hard flux while active.,
